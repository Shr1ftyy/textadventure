# textadventure - A module for building simple text adventure games in python #
This was created for a school project, a bigger project to aid in building a
much smaller project :D

## Features
 - room.py - allows user to create room objects
 - world.py - world instance, supports serialization for rooms inside it :D (using
 pickle for now)

First of all you will need to, of course, import the necessary modules:
```
from room import Room
from world import World
```
